### Agenda


- [x] Proper release schedule planning.
- [x] Amr: Tauri@2.0 apps development flow (dev server and hmr). 
- [x] Jonas: Re-design using capability-based-security for v2. [See here for the written proposal.](https://hackmd.io/@nHbRZ244RpKKhPDv8zUPCg/rypl2ibij)
- [x] Jonas & Lorenzo: Tauri Survey Reflections
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRVfQlRNeURfVtza6KurprVEYRh8nTmYaySmqz6_K4Q/edit#gid=105441987
- [x] How to open our meetings to working group or even community.

### Notes

- Stable version freeze incoming. Future tao/wry release will be merged into next branch instead.
- DevServer on Android requires a proxy which is served through `https` and won't work with `ws` which most HMR servers use to serve its changes. Other platforms don't have this restriction (iOS to be confirmed).

### Action Items

- [ ] Long term support for release.
