### Notes

- We'll see how this meeting goes to decide if we need another office hour call.
  - It seems we have enough time. Let's stick to bi-weekly WG call for now.
- Tauri won't enable telemetry by default. But there could be an option like helping bug report. It also need to respect privacy in the first place.
    - Tauri Org <- Devs, opt-in
        - Transparency, Privacy respecting
    - Potentially provide instrumentation in core for Devs <- Users
        - Never shared with Tauri Org
        - Hoped to provide best-practice guidance from the working group
    - Working group will create an RFC for discussion
- RFC template proposal is ongoing. We probably start with issues for longer discussion and PR for finalization.
- Mobile-specific plugins incoming (sensors, notifications, etc.). Users can use android and iOS API directly. This will change the plugin APIs.
    - restructuring of APIs in core to be more modular and auditable inline with a general plugin approach
    - will be good for maintenance, auditing, and cross-platform usage
    - using core api / plugins from rust has its complications, which is a benefit here
    - https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/6339
- Tauri board would like to propose new organization structure model.
    - Find out domain leads among working group members.
    - Let community understand how the structure works.
