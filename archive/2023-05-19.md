# Tauri Devs Bi-Weekly Meeting Notes

## May 19, 2023

### Agenda

- Looking for Ops & Dev Domain Leads
    - General Governance model update (@beanow)
        - https://hackmd.io/@Beanow/BJC5NXidj/%2Fmr5_odUoT-2BVBf9klBFzA
    - Looking for Governance, Community and Board Director candidates (elections soon).
        - Feel free to apply and/or nominate ahead of time :]
        - Contact the Board for this. (@board / board@tauri.app)
- Tauri v2.0.0-alpha.9 released
- Switching default branch on main repo
- Scope of 2.0 - Keeping it minimal
    - Experimental Mobile support.
        - Features except drawing something on your phone might missing. The native APIs you want to use might missing. (We have plugins to allow users to do it themselves but I don't expect most users will do so.)
        - Too much workload and too few people to deliver everything all at once.
        - Mobile Env setup is a challenge. It stays the same if you want to use Tauri.
    - Plugin workspace.
