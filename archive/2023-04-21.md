# Tauri Devs Bi-Weekly Meeting Notes

## Apr 21, 2023

### Agenda

- Mobile support updates:
    - plugin progress
        - mobile plugin RFC: https://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs/pull/9
        - API refactor RFC: https://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs/pull/10
    - tauri mobile cli overview
        - Looking for what's still missing in the CLI. For now, we are missing `cargo-mobile doctor`. This is basically check command and can add to tauri-cli, for example, `cargo ios check` and `cargo android check`.
    - beta
        - We will need to sepcify Android/iOS version, as well as for it's SDK.
    - ~~Meeting reschedule~~

## Action Items

- Future ports
    - servo
        - Yu-Wei's playground: https://github.com/wusyong/gp2
    - cef
        - Not too difficult to bind. Winit+CEF: ![](https://i.imgur.com/XyuJSye.png)
        - It can go wrong pretty fast. If we need this, it's probably going to be alternative on Linux only to cover missing features in WebkitGTK.
        - We'll only consider flatpak and make this as a flatpak extension. Consider an extension is a common practice for flatpak and it won't make every app static link into CEF.
