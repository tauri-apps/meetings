# Tauri Devs Bi-Weekly Meeting Notes

## Feb 23, 2023

### Agenda

- [x] Re-introducing an RFC Process
    - Planning to adapt the [current RFC guidelines](https://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs)
    - First step is just to create a centralised place to put RFCs
    - Slowly start to transition there, don't require any development to go through there in the beginning
    - Allows us to be more transparent OUTSIDE of Discord
    - https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1077998042982129794
- [x] SolidJS and Svelte[Kit] for "Tauri Recommendation"
    - Create a few pointers for each framework that guides a reader to choose the appropriate one
    - Prepare a talk for JSNation? [Denjell] "Blessing a Front End"
- [x] `create-tauri-app` Version 3 (because Amr is amazing)
    - [x] "Tauri Core" maintained plus community maintained templates
- [x] Path to 2.0
    - Move to a plugin-based architecture per module
    - `pnpm tauri add notification` syntax
    - https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1077624136429473832
    - Prepare the audit
    - Keep [`tauri-bindgen`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-bindgen)'s requirements in mind so we could move over to it internally in the future
    - Would we like to use the RFC process on a per-module level to practice moving these discussions out in the open?
    - How about beta-0 being when we have the core modules (required by Tauri internally) moved over to the plugin architecture?
- [x] Bi-Weekly meetings Format
    - Keep this sort of WG call to allow us to have discussions (maybe label it as a WG call, can open it up to make it transparent, though)
    - Create a Community Call that can be an update on the progress of Tauri and where it's going, RFC updates, release plans, etc.
    - Maybe start with a monthly cadence after we get RFCs started up?

    - Focusing on the criteria that guides us to a framework (the thought process on how we got to a framework)
